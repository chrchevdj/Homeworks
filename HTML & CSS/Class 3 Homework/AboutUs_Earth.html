      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
      known to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found throughout
      the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of
      Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice,
      lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land,
      consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of
      several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain
      ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates
      the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting
      destructive solar winds. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen
      and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2)
      trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor
      is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of
      the planet. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar
      regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A
      region's climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation and
      proximity to moderating oceans. In most areas severe weather, such as
      tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs and greatly
      impacts life. Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000
      km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky
      planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light
      minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days)
      to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly
      less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of
      rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane
      around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent
      natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light
      seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces
      the Earth with the same side through tidal locking and causes tides,
      stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth, like
      most other Solar System bodies formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas of
      the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history
      the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally
      and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great
      Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago,
      and have reached a population of almost 8 billion today. Humans depend on
      Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have
      increasingly impacted Earth's environment. Today, humanity's impact on
      Earth's climate, soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable,
      threatening people's lives and causing widespread extinction of other
      life.[26] The Modern English word Earth developed, via Middle English,
      from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe.[27] It has cognates in
      every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed
      as *erþō. In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was already being
      used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ gē: the
      ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world
      (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and
      Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic
      paganism: late Norse mythology included Jörð ('Earth'), a giantess often
      given as the mother of Thor.[28] Historically, earth has been written in
      lowercase. From early Middle English, its definite sense as "the globe"
      was expressed as the earth. By the era of Early Modern English,
      capitalization of nouns began to prevail, and the earth was also written
      the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies.
      More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy
      with the names of the other planets, though earth and forms with the
      remain common.[27] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the
      lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable
      variant. Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name
      (for example, "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when
      preceded by the (for example, "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost
      always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on
      earth are you doing?"[29] Occasionally, the name Terra /ˈtɛrə/ is used in
      scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish
      humanity's inhabited planet from others,[30] while in poetry Tellus
      /ˈtɛləs/ has been used to denote personification of the Earth.[31] Terra
      is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that
      evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance
      languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings
      (like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre). The Latinate form Gæa or
      Gaea (English: /ˈdʒiː.ə/) of the Greek poetic name Gaia (Γαῖα; Ancient
      Greek: [ɡâi̯.a] or [ɡâj.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling Gaia
      has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its
      pronunciation is /ˈɡaɪ.ə/ rather than the more classical English
      /ˈɡeɪ.ə/.[32] There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From
      Earth itself comes earthly. From the Latin Terra comes terran
      /ˈtɛrən/,[33] terrestrial /təˈrɛstriəl/,[34] and (via French) terrene
      /təˈriːn/,[35] and from the Latin Tellus comes tellurian /tɛˈlʊəriən/[36]
      and telluric.[37]
